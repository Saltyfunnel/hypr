☘️ Saltyfunnel’s “Hypr” Garbage Dump

The Proof I Shouldn’t Be Trusted Within Fifty Feet of a Keyboard

💬 Jaysus, What’s This Then?

Welcome to me Hyprland config — or as I like to call it, “a feckin’ disgrace with animations.”
If you’ve come lookin’ for best practices, you’ve taken a wrong turn down the arse end of GitHub.

This repo is a shrine to chaos, procrastination, and sheer stubborn willpower.
Every line of code here is a cry for help wrapped in CSS and false confidence.

It works, mostly, which is the most upsetting part.

🧱 The “Tech Stack” (Built on Other People’s Backs)

Let’s be honest: the only thing I actually made here was a folder called hypr.
Everything else was cobbled together by ChatGPT while I sat there goin’, “Aye, that’ll do.”

🌀 Hyprland

The window manager that’s far too classy for the likes of me.
I barely understand half the config, but sure look — it moves windows around and that’s grand.

🎨 pywal16

The only thing holdin’ this whole circus together.
It picks the colours based on me wallpaper, which means every reboot is a new gamble between “not bad” and “holy feck, me eyes.”

🧱 Waybar

A bar so “custom” I once spent 45 minutes movin’ the feckin’ clock and called it progress.
Half the modules don’t even feckin’ work, but it looks busy so I’m keepin’ it.

🚀 Tofi

A launcher that’s faster than me internet, which isn’t sayin’ much.
I only use it to open the terminal anyway — the one app I actually know how to use.
Absolute overkill, but it feels posh.

🧠 setwallpaper.sh

This script is pure gobshite.
It changes the wallpaper, updates the colours, and occasionally decides to delete reality.
If your screen goes black — don’t worry, that’s normal. It’s havin’ a think.

⚠️ Installation (Proceed, Ye Eejit)

Right, listen. If you run these commands, that’s on you.
You’re basically givin’ a stranger’s bash script the keys to your feckin’ system.
I warned ye.
