💻 Saltyfunnel’s “Hypr” Garbage Dump

(AKA: The Proof I Should Not Be Allowed Near a Keyboard)

Look, I Get It — You’re Here For The Trash Fire

Welcome, brave soul. What you’ve found here isn’t a slick, optimized setup. It’s a shrine to mediocrity, a digital junk drawer of copy-pasted configs and desperate trial-and-error sessions.

These are my Hyprland dotfiles — a fragile web of scripts, colours, and ideas I only half understand. Somehow, against all logic, it mostly works.

🛠️ The Stack (A.K.A. Everyone Else’s Hard Work)

Let’s be honest: I didn’t build this. I assembled it — like IKEA furniture without the instructions or the little hex key.

Hyprland: The only reason I haven’t gone back to GNOME yet.

pywal16: The hero of the story. Chooses my colours because I absolutely shouldn’t be trusted to.

Waybar: I once changed the font and called it “custom.” Sometimes it just disappears like it saw something it shouldn’t have.

Tofi: Sleek, modern, and utterly uncooperative. Won’t open in a terminal, won’t behave, just sits there mocking me.

The Install Script: A chaotic spell written in bash. May summon either beauty or destruction.
⚠️ Installation (Proceed If You Hate Yourself)

Let’s be clear: you’re about to execute a random script written by a guy who once broke his desktop changing a font.

But sure, let’s dance with danger.

    git clone https://github.com/Saltyfunnel/hypr
    cd hypr
    chmod +x scripts/*.sh
    cd scripts
    sudo sh install.sh

After that, it’s all downhill. Expect missing dependencies, rogue keybinds, and enough confusion to fill a small wiki.

💩 Known “Features” (Things That Are Definitely Broken)

Waybar occasionally disappears for dramatic effect.

Hyprland sometimes crashes just to remind me who’s boss.

The wallpaper script has achieved sentience and now resents me.

Colour schemes are entirely mood-based — by the computer’s mood, not mine.

If it all actually works, congratulations — you’re clearly more powerful than I am.

ChatGPT: My unpaid dev team, emotional support system, and co-author of this disaster.

pywal16 devs: Wizards. Absolute wizards.

Everyone on r/unixporn: I stole your configs with pride and zero understanding.

Me: Somehow still booting into Hyprland every morning like nothing’s wrong.

💫 Wisdom from the Abyss

“If it ain’t broke, it soon will be.”

Minimalism is just a fancy word for “I gave up.”

Rebooting fixes everything until it doesn’t.

Every success here is an accident.

🔥 Final Thoughts

If this setup works for you, good on you — you’ve achieved something I never did: stability.
If it doesn’t, welcome to the club. Grab a coffee, open your logs, and start guessing.

This repo is not a guide. It’s a cautionary tale.
But hey, it looks nice for five minutes at a time — and that’s something.

License: Do whatever you want with this. Fork it, fix it, burn it, print it on a mug.
Just don’t tag me when it breaks. I’m busy pretending it works.
