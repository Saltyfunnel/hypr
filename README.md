💥 The Hyprland Catastrophe™

“Because why rice like a pro when you can improvise with tears?” — Saltyfunnel, 2025

💀 Welcome to My Hyprland Repo

This is my Hyprland setup, a masterpiece of confusion, duct tape, and broken configs,.
It’s the digital equivalent of building IKEA furniture with missing screws and a prayer.

If you clone this repo, you are no longer just a user — you’re an accomplice.

🧩 What’s Inside (besides fear)
🌀 Hyprland

My window manager of choice — because I like pretty animations and unexplained crashes.
Half my configs don’t make sense, and the other half only work on full moons.

🧱 Waybar

A bar that’s supposed to show useful info like time, CPU, and network — but mostly shows me how little I understand CSS.
It sometimes forgets to exist. That’s a feature now.

🎨 Pywal16

Dynamic color schemes that promise coordination and deliver chaos.
Every new wallpaper is a roll of the dice: Will it match? Sometimes it nails the palette; sometimes it looks like a clown funeral. Tune in and find out.

🖼️ swww

Wallpapers that fade beautifully, when it feels like cooperating.
Sometimes it just stops working because it can.
I respect that kind of energy.

🧠 setwallpaper.sh

A “simple” script that somehow turned into a cryptid.
It calls Pywal, swww, and the forces of chaos in one go.
Sometimes it updates colors. Sometimes it spawns four daemons and sets your background to pure black.
There is no in-between.

💾 JetBrains Nerd Mono

The font equivalent of “at least something looks professional around here.”

⚡ Installation (Not Recommended)

If you want to live dangerously:


🤡 Known “Features”

Colors randomly commit war crimes.

Waybar sometimes goes to therapy mid-session.

Hyprland forgets monitors like I forget to save files.

swww acts normal just long enough to lull you into a false sense of security.

Pywal16 is basically a mood generator with a terminal interface.

🖼️ Showcase (The Theater of Imagination)
“What It Looks Like When It Works”

Imagine a perfectly themed desktop, smooth animations, cohesive colors, and peace.
Now imagine it crashing one second later. That’s the vibe.

“Why There Are No Screenshots”

Because I don’t have a screenshot tool installed.
That’s not laziness — that’s performance art.

“What It Actually Looks Like”

A chaotic symphony of colors, bars, and terminals where somehow, against all odds, it kinda works. Sometimes.

🧘‍♂️ Philosophy

This repo isn’t about perfection.
It’s about the journey — through Hyprland logs, error messages, and moments of fleeting beauty before your wallpaper reverts to black again.

It’s not broken; it’s just exploring alternative functionality.

🫠 Final Words

If this config works, congratulations — you’ve achieved something even I couldn’t.
If it doesn’t, welcome to the Hyprland experience:
chaotic, colorful, slightly broken, and somehow… kinda beautiful.

“It’s not just a setup — it’s a cry for help wrapped in pretty colors.”
