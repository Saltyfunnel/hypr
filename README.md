💻 Saltyfunnel’s “Hypr” Garbage Dump

(AKA: The Proof I Should Not Be Allowed Near a Keyboard)

Look, I Get It — You’re Here For The Trash Fire

Welcome, brave soul. What you’ve stumbled across isn’t a polished setup — it’s a chaotic shrine to trial and error, built by someone who thought “configuring a window manager” meant “copying random snippets from Reddit and praying.”

These are my Hyprland dotfiles — a collection of half-baked ideas, broken scripts, and settings I barely understand. This repo is living proof that with enough caffeine and stubbornness, you too can produce something that almost works.

If you came looking for elegance or logic, stop now. This is duct tape, desperation, and misplaced confidence all the way down.

🛠️ The Stack (A.K.A. Everyone Else’s Hard Work)

I didn’t build this setup so much as I assembled it, like a raccoon rummaging through /r/unixporn.

Hyprland: The crown jewel. Too beautiful for the mess I’ve made around it.

pywal16: Automatically picks colours based on my wallpaper, which is great because I have the design taste of a potato.

Waybar: I moved the clock once, felt accomplished, and never touched it again. Sometimes it vanishes out of spite.

Tofi: Supposed to be a slick app launcher. Doesn’t even open in a terminal. Useless but pretty — just like me.

The Install Script: A Frankenstein’s monster of shell commands that somehow works. Occasionally.

⚠️ Installation (Proceed If You Hate Yourself)

Let’s be clear: you’re about to execute a random script written by a guy who once broke his desktop changing a font.

But sure, let’s dance with danger.

    git clone https://github.com/Saltyfunnel/hypr
    cd hypr
    chmod +x scripts/*.sh
    cd scripts
    sudo sh install.sh

After that, your computer’s fate is entirely your own. Expect missing packages, misconfigured paths, and keybinds that launch mysterious apps you’ve never seen before.

💩 Known “Features” (Things That Are Definitely Broken)

Waybar disappears whenever it feels like it.

Hyprland crashes for fun.

Tofi refuses to open in a terminal out of sheer defiance.

Wallpaper script runs on dark magic and bad intentions.

The colors change depending on whether the moon’s in retrograde.

If it all actually works, congratulations — you’ve summoned the Linux gods.

🙏 Credits (The Real Heroes)

ChatGPT: My unpaid intern, moral support, and the only reason any of this exists.

pywal16 devs: You made this mess look vaguely aesthetic. I owe you several beers.

Everyone on r/unixporn: I stole your ideas shamelessly.

Me: Somehow didn’t nuke my install. Barely.

💫 Wisdom from the Abyss

Don’t copy this expecting stability. This is a warning, not a tutorial.

If it breaks, reboot. If it still breaks, reinstall.

Minimalist ≠ functional.

The moment you think “it’s finally working,” something will explode.

🔥 Final Thoughts

If this repo runs perfectly for you, congrats — you’re either a genius or a liar.
If it doesn’t, welcome to the experience. Hyprland isn’t a window manager, it’s a personality test.

This is my digital junk drawer, my monument to stubbornness, and somehow... I’m proud of it.

License: Do whatever you want. Fork it, fix it, mock it, print it on a T-shirt. Just don’t tag me when it breaks. I’ve suffered enough.
