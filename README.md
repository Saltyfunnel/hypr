# My Current Hyprland Dotfiles

#### A simple config that just works

---

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> No guarantee it will work on your machine â€” works on mine, but should work on yours too.

---

> [!NOTE]
> I use paru (AUR helper) so if you'll use yay then remove the ``alias yay="paru"`` line in ``/.config/fish/config.fish``

> [!NOTE]
> If you are not using nvidia gpu you should delete the nvidia fix env's in ``/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf``
