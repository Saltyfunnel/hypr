☘️ Saltyfunnel’s “Hypr” Garbage Dump

The Proof I Shouldn’t Be Trusted Within Fifty Feet of a Keyboard

💬 Jaysus, What’s This Then?

Welcome to me Hyprland config — or as I like to call it, “a feckin’ disgrace with animations.”
If you’ve come lookin’ for best practices, you’ve taken a wrong turn down the arse end of GitHub.

This repo is a shrine to chaos, procrastination, and sheer stubborn willpower.
Every line of code here is a cry for help wrapped in CSS and false confidence.

It works, mostly, which is the most upsetting part.

🧱 The “Tech Stack” (Built on Other People’s Backs)

Let’s be honest: the only thing I actually made here was a folder called hypr.
Everything else was cobbled together by ChatGPT while I sat there goin’, “Aye, that’ll do.”

🌀 Hyprland

The window manager that’s far too classy for the likes of me.
I barely understand half the config, but sure look — it moves windows around and that’s grand.

🎨 pywal16

The only thing holdin’ this whole circus together.
It picks the colours based on me wallpaper, which means every reboot is a new gamble between “not bad” and “holy feck, me eyes.”

🧱 Waybar

A bar so “custom” I once spent 45 minutes movin’ the feckin’ clock and called it progress.
Half the modules don’t even feckin’ work, but it looks busy so I’m keepin’ it.

🚀 Tofi

A launcher that’s faster than me internet, which isn’t sayin’ much.
I only use it to open the terminal anyway — the one app I actually know how to use.
Absolute overkill, but it feels posh.

🧠 setwallpaper.sh

This script is pure gobshite.
It changes the wallpaper, updates the colours, and occasionally decides to delete reality.
If your screen goes black — don’t worry, that’s normal. It’s havin’ a think.

⚠️ Installation (Proceed, Ye Eejit)

Right, listen. If you run these commands, that’s on you.
You’re basically givin’ a stranger’s bash script the keys to your feckin’ system.
I warned ye.


git clone https://github.com/Saltyfunnel/hypr
cd hypr
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
cd scripts
sudo sh install.sh

After that last one, your machine’s fate is sealed.
Expect missing packages, random crashes, and maybe a new keybind that plays “The Fields of Athenry” for no apparent reason.

If it does work, light a candle — you’ve witnessed a miracle.

🪦 Known “Features” (Aka Things That’ll Feckin’ Break)

Waybar disappears like me motivation.

Colours sometimes look like a bag of Skittles exploded.

Hyprland forgets me monitor exists mid-session.

The scripts act sentient but mostly act thick.

The config folder’s half commented-out chaos.

If somethin’ breaks, that’s not a bug — that’s a feature with attitude.

🧠 Philosophy (Sort Of)

I didn’t make this to be perfect.
I made it to look cool for five seconds before it implodes.

It’s not about stability — it’s about vibes.
If it crashes, that’s just Hyprland’s way of remindin’ you to touch grass.

📸 Screenshots

None. Because I forgot to install a screenshot tool.
Call it “minimalism.”
Picture something vaguely colourful, slightly misaligned, and powered by blind faith.

🙏 Credits (The Legends Behind the Madness)

ChatGPT — the real dev. I just pressed Enter.

pywal16 Devs — saints, the lot of ye.

Hyprland Team — I’m sorry for what I’ve done to your creation.

r/unixporn — I robbed your ideas wholesale. Thanks.

Me — for typin’ sudo and not immediately blowin’ up me system.

📜 License

License: “Use It & Cry” v1.0

Ye can clone it, fork it, or delete it immediately — your call.

Comes with no guarantees, no documentation, and no moral support.

If it works, I’m as surprised as you are.

💬 Final Thoughts

If you’re usin’ this repo for inspiration — don’t.
If it somehow works — take a photo before it explodes.
If it crashes — pour yourself a pint and blame the AI.

“It’s not just a config. It’s a feckin’ lifestyle of disappointment.”
