💥 The Hyprland Catastrophe™

“Because stability is for people who use GNOME.” — Gerard, 2025

💀 Welcome to My Hyprland Repo

This is my Hyprland setup, a masterpiece of confusion, duct tape, and accidental genius.
It’s the digital equivalent of building IKEA furniture with missing screws and a prayer.

If you clone this repo, you are no longer just a user — you’re an accomplice.

🧩 What’s Inside (besides fear)
🌀 Hyprland

The window manager I love, hate, and constantly break.
Tiling, animations, and the occasional existential crisis — all in one package.

🧱 Waybar

My “custom” bar that displays random system stats and sometimes disappears for emotional reasons.
Half CSS, half Stockholm Syndrome.

🎨 Pywal16

Dynamic color schemes that promise coordination and deliver chaos.
Every new wallpaper is a roll of the dice: Will it match? Will it look like a radioactive fruit salad? Tune in and find out.

🖼️ swww-daemon

Wallpapers that fade gracefully between disappointment and glory.
It’s like a screensaver that also controls my blood pressure.

🧠 setwallpaper.sh

A script forged in pain.
It runs Pywal16, updates Waybar colors, and sometimes breaks everything else in the process.
If your wallpaper turns black — that’s its way of saying, “I need a minute.”

💾 JetBrains Nerd Mono

The font equivalent of “at least something looks professional around here.”
