## 🧠 What This Repo Actually Is

A **mess of trial, error, and desperation**.  
Built by someone with caffeine, luck, and zero design sense.  

These are my **Hyprland dotfiles** — fragile, barely functional, chaotic.  
It *might work*. Sometimes. If you’re lucky.

> ⚠️ Note: In your `hyprland.conf`, the first line is commented out with a `#`. To make wallpaper changes work, you need to Super + `w` to change wallpaper **and** remove the `#` from that first line.

### 🧩 The Stack (a.k.a. Everything I Didn’t Build Myself)

| Tool | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **Hyprland** | The only thing here that actually works consistently. |
| **pywal16** | Chooses colors because I clearly can’t. |
| **Waybar** | Works occasionally. Disappears for fun. |
| **Tofi** | Fancy app launcher. Exists mainly to look cool and mock you. |
| **Install Script** | Bash spaghetti held together with hope and panic. |

### ⚠️ Installation (Proceed If You Hate Yourself)

You’re about to run a script written by someone who once broke their system installing a cursor theme.  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Saltyfunnel/hypr
cd hypr
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
cd scripts
sudo sh install.sh
```

💀 **Results may include:** broken packages, rogue keybinds, missing dependencies, existential despair.

### 🎞️ The Fake Screenshot Gallery

> **Hyprland on a Good Day**  
> ✨ Everything aligns. Bars behave. Colors match.  
> I’d show you, but I never installed a screenshot tool. Imagine it.

> **Hyprland After an Update**  
> 💥 Gaps: gone. Fonts: missing. Wallpaper: black hole. Chaos reigns.

> **Waybar in the Morning**  
> “Everything works.”

> **Waybar by Afternoon**  
> *Segmentation fault (core dumped)*

> **Tofi**  
> Launches apps. Looks fancy. Exists mainly to mock you.

> **Me, configuring anything:**  
> 🧍 “I don’t understand this line. I’ll leave it anyway.”

### ❓ FAQ (Frequently Asked Stupid Questions)

**Q: Why doesn’t anything work?**  
A: Because you copied my config. That’s it.

**Q: Why are my colors insane?**  
A: pywal16 did it. You did not. Accept it.

**Q: Waybar disappeared, what now?**  
A: Reboot. Cry. Repeat.

**Q: Will this work on a minimal Arch install?**  
A: Yes, it installs. That doesn’t mean it works correctly. Tears expected.

### 🔥 Final Thoughts

If this actually works — congratulations, you’re a wizard.  
If it doesn’t — welcome to the club. Grab coffee and despair together.

This isn’t a *guide.* It’s a *warning label with jokes.*  
But hey… it looks decent for five minutes, and that counts.

Just don’t tag me when it breaks. I’m pretending it works.
